                                                Today you hear a lot about inflation, the job market, supply issues, wages, the housing market, etc. - the list goes on and on. The benefit to not talking about salary falls mostly on the employer. Weâ€™ve long heard and felt that it is taboo to talk about how much people are being paid. We aim to be disruptive and using technology we want to bring your salary/wage to light. Your wage is a large part of your lively hood and access to transparent salary/wage information will only benefit you. <br><br>
                                                By choosing to participate with your peers we hope that each person receives the clarity that was previously too hard to talk through.
