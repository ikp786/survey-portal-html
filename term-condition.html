                        affiliates, divisions, contractors, and all data sources and suppliers, (collectively “Oview”, “we”,
                        “us” or
                        “our”) – a global online platform where opinions are created, acknowledged and transformed into
                        universally
                        accessible visualised data with the intention to induce a civilization that is inspired by the
                        freely
                        created opinions of the majority, which are supported by unbiased information. </p>
                <p>Oview provides access to a system where users can:</p>
                <p>– create polar questions (Yes/No questions) about current articles (the
                        “survey questions”).
                        This is
                        done via the backend;</p>
                <p>– answer the survey
                        questions.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that all analysis of the survey results such as
                        reports,
                        statistical tables, charts, graphics or other visual forms (“statistical reports”), are always
                        aggregated
                        into statistical information without compromising individual votes.</p>
                <p>For these purposes Oview asks you to provide your personal data which
                        will be
                        used by Oview to create statistical reports based on personal opinions about different news
                        articles, items,
                        issues, topics, and other internet sources which users link while creating their survey questions in
                        order
                        to help other users to
                        understand the general context of these survey questions (the
                        “articles”). Oview provides you with access to our services only after you create an account in
                        Oview as
                        defined in the Privacy Policy in the part “Registration in Oview”. As soon as you sign the Terms and
                        Conditions and finish the whole registration process in the Oview backend
                            of the app or in the
                            mobile
                            app (the “registration”), your personal data will be transferred to Oview and you will
                        become an
                        Oview user (the “user”). Becoming an Oview user contains the right to express your opinion by
                        voluntary
                        participation in survey questions and/or the right to create survey questions. </p>
                <p>Oview controls personal data. It collects and processes personal data
                        only for
                        the purposes of Oview activities. Oview respects your privacy and complies with Dutch&nbsp;and

                        includes your name, birth date, gender, education level, location (city), language preference and/or
                        other
                        categories of personal data which Oview will decide to include in the future. Providing this
                        personal data
                        is optional, and it determines the amount of information in statistical reports the user will be
                        able to see
                        after responding to the survey questions; meaning; providing your personal data gives access to the
                        corresponding aggregated data in the statistics reports. It is possible at any point to remove
                        and/or add
                        personal data, and that will immediately change the extent of access to the relevant statistical
                        reports.</p>
